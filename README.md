Create a Java program that models various geometric shapes (e.g., circle, square, rectangle) using object-oriented programming concepts. Each shape should be represented by a separate class with appropriate attributes and methods to calculate its area, perimeter, and, if applicable, radius.
 
    The program should have a base abstract class called "Shape" which defines common properties and methods for all shapes.
    Implement concrete classes for specific shapes like "Circle," "Square," and "Rectangle" and "ellipse" that extend the "Shape" class.
    Each shape class should contain methods to calculate its area and perimeter.
    The "Circle" class should have a method to calculate its radius.
 
Example functionalities to include:
 
    For a circle:
        Calculate the area of a circle.
        Calculate the circumference .
        Retrieve and set the radius.
 
    For a square:
        Calculate the area of a square.
        Calculate the perimeter .
        Retrieve and set the side length.
 
    For a rectangle:
        Calculate the area of rectangle
        Calculate the perimeter.
        Retrieve and set the length and width.
    For a ellipse(The "Ellipse" class should contain attributes representing its major and minor axes):
        Calculate the area of the ellipse
        Calculate the approximate circumference of the ellipse
        Implement methods to retrieve and set the major and minor axes.
 
    Ensure that the program demonstrates proper encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction concepts of object-oriented programming. Also, consider incorporating error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative values for dimensions) and provide appropriate messages or exceptions.
